# Gas-turbine-data-processing
Raw data records of gas turbine operations are processed for prediction and operational forecasting.g 

## Description
In this project, I received raw measurement data from a gas turbine. The data was messy and not usable in its original form; it consisted of time-recorded measurements of various sensors from the gas turbine, saved in a text file. Additionally, the data samples were recorded at random intervals. My role was to clean, organise, resample, and convert this raw data into a single CSV file that includes all the measurements. This consolidated file will be used for prediction, forecasting, and tuning the control system.  
## Notebook steps 
1. Getting the data ready
2. Convert test files to CSV format
3. Explore CSV files
4. Converting object data to useful data types
5. Filtering the data
6. Creating a single dataset of all measured  variables
